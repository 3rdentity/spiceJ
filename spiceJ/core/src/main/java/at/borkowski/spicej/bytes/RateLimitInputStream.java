/**
 * Provides an {@link InputStream} with a limited rate of bytes.
 * 
 * A stream has two modes: boring and non-boring. The boring flag modifies he
 * behavior of {@link #read(byte[], int, int)} and {@link #read(byte[])}.
 * 
 * According to {@link InputStream}, they method read between 1 and n bytes,
 * where n is the size of the effective buffer.
 * 
 * If the {@link RateLimitInputStream} is in boring mode, the methods block
 * until all actually available bytes have been read, even if many ticks must be
 * waited for the data to become available according to the set rate.
 * 
 * In non-boring mode, the methods do not block and read only data which can be
 * read immediately (except for the first byte which, according to the
 * definition of {@link InputStream}, causes blocking for all read methods).
 * 
 * Streams are non-boring by default.

    * The prescale divides the incoming ticks by a constant number. A prescale
    * of 1 means that each tick coming from the tick source is counting towards
    * the rate, a prescale of 2 means every second, and so on. The prescale can
    * be used to achieve low byte rates, ie. rates below 1 byte per tick.
